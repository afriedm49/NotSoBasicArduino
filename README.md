## LED_Fade

### Description & Code


Here's how you make code look like code:

```C++
  analogWrite(led, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
```

This is used to fade an led on and off. The Led will go from on to off slowly in a specific amount of time.

### Reflection
This helped me remember how to write basic code. In Engineering 1 last year, we made this exact code, but I didn't remember how to do it until now.
